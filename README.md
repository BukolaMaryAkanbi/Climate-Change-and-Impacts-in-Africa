# Climate-Change-and-Impacts-in-Africa

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While natural factors like changes in the sun's activity and volcanic eruptions can contribute, human activities have become the primary driver since the 1800s. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas plays a significant role. 
As a result, we're experiencing intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms, and a decline in biodiversity. It's crucial for us to address these issues and take action to protect our planet.

In this project, I clean, combine, and analyze the dataset to create a comprehensive report on the state of climate change in Africa. Additionally, I provide valuable insights on the impact of climate change on specific African regions by using four countries, one from each African region, as case studies.
